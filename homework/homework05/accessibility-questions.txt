Please answer the following accessibility questions:

    What corrections did you have to make?
	
		Add alt text to each image
		
		Add aria-label to the buttons
		
		Newest wave version also requires invisible text on the bottons because certain screen readers do not work well with aria-labels.
		This was giving red errors until fixed.
		To solve this I added a span element with text inside and then set the span class name to have 0 height and 0 font size.
	
	
    Do you think your website is usable if you turn off the CSS? Why or why not?
		
		Yes, the website is usable without CSS turned on.
		To test, I unlinked the stylesheets and was still able to click on play buttons and music controls.
	
    Is your site is tabbable? In other words, without the use of the mouse, are all the links and buttons accessible using the tab key?
		
		Yes, the website can be navigated with tab, all of the important options can be reached, including the play button for each album
		and the overall music controls.
