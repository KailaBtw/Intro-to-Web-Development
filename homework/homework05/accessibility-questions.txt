Please answer the following accessibility questions:


1. What accessibility corrections did you have to make?


2. Do you think your website is usable if you turn off the CSS? Why or why not?


3. Is your site is tabbable? In other words, without the use of the mouse, are all the links and buttons accessible using the tab key?
