•	What corrections did you have to make, and how did you make them?

	The search form (search for artist) needed an aria label so I added aria-label=”search artist” to the form html attributes.
	Language was not defined for the web page <html lang="en"> was added to head to solve that problem.
	Images needed alt text so alt attribute was added to getArtist and used the artist name, or albums name as alt. 
	That is all of the errors, there were 10 alerts that are false positives.
 
 
•	Is this interface functional without the use of a mouse (i.e., just using keyboard keys)? Why or why not?

	Yes, I was able to use the website without using a mouse, the only thing I was not able to access with tab was the song list panel on the right, but I think screen readers would work.

•	What are other accessibility tests or features you added or would be interested in learning about?

	What hotkeys can be used to navigate web pages?
